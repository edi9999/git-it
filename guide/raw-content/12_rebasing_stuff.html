      <div class="challenge">
        <h2>The Challenge:</h2>
        <p>Learn about rebasing, and rebase the doc branch onto the master branch</p>
       </div>

      <h2>Step: Clone the git repository</h2>

      <p>We setup a git repository so that you can train to do git rebase</p>

      <p><code>$ git clone https://github.com/edi9999/git-test-iut.git</code></p>

      <h2>Step: View the commit graph</h2>

      <p>We want to see what the git graph looks like. We have multiple solutions for this.
      To see the commits, you can use one of the multiple git guis (SourceTree, ou SmartGit, ou tig, ou gitk)</p>

      <p>Try this command</p>

      <p><code>$ gitk --all</code></p>

      <h2>Step: Rebase the doc branch into the master branch</h2>

      <p>The repository has two branches : <b>master</b> and <b>doc</b>.</p>

      <p>As you can see, the doc branch starts on an old commit of master. What rebase does is to change the
          starting point of a branch, to an other commit. What we want to do here is to set the starting commit of
      the branch <b>doc</b> to be <b>master</b>.</p>

      <p>First, checkout to the <b>doc</b> branch. If you don't remember how to do this, open the page about branches</p>

      <p>We want to rebase the branch onto <b>master</b>. To rebase a branch onto another branch, we just have to write</p>

      <p><code>$ git rebase `branch`</code></p>

      <p>where branch is the branch we want to rebase the currently checked out branch</p>
